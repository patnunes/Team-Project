# SOEN341 - Winter 2019;

## Objective(s):
 - Deploying a "Twitter-like" website containing core features which include allowing users **to post** short-messages, **to like** short-messages, and **to follow** other users. Each user will have a profile which will be created upon Signing-up; these profiles will contain general information of the user, such as their name(s), email address(es), Github username(s), etc. 

 - *More features will be implemented; TBD with customer (Zhenhao Li)*

## Programming Language(s) & Structure:
 -  ### Language(s) *[TBD by January 30th 2019]*
    - Below is/are our Project's *programming language(s)*;
      - [Input Language(s) here]
 
 -  ### Structure
    - Below is an example of our Project's *programming structure* which includes;
      - Camel Case declaration
      - Open bracket ("{") on same line as Function / Method declaration
      - Insert a New Line (represented as \n below) before declaring new Function / Method
      - Close a Function / method with *//end of functionName();*
      - Seperation of Concern (SoC) methodology;
      - [More TBD]
