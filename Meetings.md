## TIMELINE: SPRINT 1; January 18th 2019 --> January 30th 2019

#### Meeting 1
- **January 18th 2019**; 10/10 Members present; duration ***1-hour***
   - First full team meeting. We introduced ourselves and started to discuss the programming languages which each team member is comfortable with;
   - A decision on which language will be used has not been yet determined; Programming language knowhow will be added to the Contact_Information.md file;
   - A second meeting will take place in-order to decide which language will be chosen;
   

#### Meeting 2 (Online Discussion - Refer to: Sprint1-04: Deciding on Programming Language(s) #7)
 - **January 21st 2019**; 5/10 Members (so far) participated;
   - Ricky:
     * Backend: Python (Django) with MariaDB or MySQL as database. Python is simple to pick up for those that don't know it, and is extremely powerful. Django will produce a simple, functional backend, which is exactly what we need for this project.
     * Frontend: No preference.
     
   - Filip:
     * I have little knowledge on web-based programming; I will be learning the Language that we decide on.
   
   - Syn:
     * Same as Fil
   
    - Patricia:
      * Backend: PHP and MySQL would allow us to build a functional twitter-like website. PHP allows for easy configuration and development and is overall pretty straightforward. However, I am open to learning new things and wouldn't mind using a different language. 
      * Frontend: I think our best option is to use HTML, CSS and JS; All of which have tons of resources online if you are a beginner. 
   
    - Johnston:
      * Frontend: I definitely think we should consider JavaScript (among others possibly), many of us have used it before and as mentioned there are many resources available for help.
      * Backend: No real experience with it, but Python seems like a good option based on what Ricky brought up. Open to learning new things.
