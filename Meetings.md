*This document will contain all of the meetings throughout the 2019 Winter Semester*

## TIMELINE: SPRINT 1; January 18th 2019 --> January 30th 2019

### Meeting 1 (In-person)
- **January 18th 2019**; 10/10 Members present; duration ***1-hour***
   - First full team meeting. We introduced ourselves and started to discuss the programming languages which each team member is comfortable with;
   - A decision on which language will be used has not been yet determined; Programming language knowhow will be added to the Contact_Information.md file;
   - A second meeting will take place in-order to decide which language will be chosen;
   

### Meeting 2 (Online Discussion - Refer to: Sprint1-04: Deciding on Programming Language(s) #7)
 - **January 21st 2019**; 7/10 Members (so far) participated;
   - Ricky:
     * Backend: Python (Django) with MariaDB or MySQL as database. Python is simple to pick up for those that don't know it, and is extremely powerful. Django will produce a simple, functional backend, which is exactly what we need for this project.
     * Frontend: No preference.
     
   - Filip:
     * I have little knowledge on web-based programming; I will be learning the Language that we decide on.
   
   - Syn:
     * Same as Fil
   
    - Patricia:
      * Backend: PHP and MySQL would allow us to build a functional twitter-like website. PHP allows for easy configuration and development and is overall pretty straightforward. However, I am open to learning new things and wouldn't mind using a different language. 
      * Frontend: I think our best option is to use HTML, CSS and JS; All of which have tons of resources online if you are a beginner. 
   
    - Johnston:
      * Backend: No real experience with it, but Python seems like a good option based on what Ricky brought up. Open to learning new things.
      * Frontend: I definitely think we should consider JavaScript (among others possibly), many of us have used it before and as mentioned there are many resources available for help.
      
     - Hossein:
       * Backend: I have no exprience in Backend, but I always wanted to add Python to my skills and if it is possible to do it using Python then I am okay with learning it.
       * Frontend: My choice is HTML, CSS and JS, and I think that would be the easier part that we can all implement and learn.
      
     - Noah
       * Backend: I do not have expeience with backend. Up to learning something new, Python seems promising. 
       * Frontend: HTML, CSS and JS seem to be the most widely known. I think we should consider using bootstrap for design, it will result in quick implementation of design aspects, so we can focus on features and functionality. We can also use Jquery to streamline javascript. Both have great resources. 
       
      - GD
       * Backend: No real experience developing a backend system but open to learning and using any language. 
       * Frontend: HTML, CSS and JS are a comfort zone but again very open to learning and using any language.
